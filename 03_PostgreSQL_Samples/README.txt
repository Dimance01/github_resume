Hi,

You can find in this folder a range of PostgreSQL function which I have been writing and prove my skills at this language.

The folder HF_test contains an SQL exercise I had to complete during one of my former applications.

The folder BAT_ex contains examples of SQL functions I have been developing during my past experiences. I picked only a few ones, showing the use of diverse SQL
methods:
	- city_cpa_processing.sql: Function using Adwords Geoperformance report and Salesforce data to process a large table enabling CPA_per_city calculation per
	channel over time (NB: including Facebook CPA per City, estimated by reproducing the costs' split per region of Adwords on Facebook regions.
	- city_longlat_matching: Function using geographical coordinate stored in JSON fields in order to match each company order with company-defined business 
	areas.
	- retention_rate_processing.sql: Function used to process data for retention rate calculations on Tableau Software.
	- visits_to_transaction_matching: Function classifying then looping through records in order to match all visits, in each visitors' traffic history, to
	the transaction they lead to.
