Hi,

This folder contains a sample of a Django backend I had to code for a 3-hours exercise at a Company named 3YOURMIND.
You can find the exercise requirements in the file exercise_readme.pdf in this directory.

You can also test the website locally by running the "manage.py runserver" command.

Please note that this exercise is absolutely not optimized, neither finished - as you can see on the .pdf file it is a lot for three hours - but I want to 
keep working on it as a proof of my basics with Django framework.
